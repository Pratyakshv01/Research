Outlook
According to the latest study by Transparency Market Research, "Wafer Laser Scribing Equipment Market - Global Industry Analysis, Trend, Size, Share and Forecast 2014 - 2020", major factors and emerging trends are set to bring a somewhat exaggerating growth in the global wafer laser scribing equipment market for the next two years. In the progressive evolution of the industry, semiconductor manufacture became synonymous with the increasing demand for accuracy and efficiency in wafer production; hence, laser scribing technology became a core driver of the industry's advanced manufacturing process. More importantly, in view of the very nature of laser scribing, one is able to etch very complicated patterns in the formation of silicon wafers for acquiring high-density, high-performance semiconductor components at the highest precision achievable, even as small as very small scales. It is therefore core technology for use in developing integrated circuits for consumer electronics like smartphones and tablets, new, emergent industries of electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems in usage that is critical to the cutting edge of semiconductor components. Advancements in laser technology are also adding fuel to the market. These range from furthering better laser power and beam qualities to automation that increases the speed and accuracy of the scribing processes. Additionally, the electronic device will become smaller in size and further increased in functionality, thereby calling for sophisticated scribing solutions. It will be the drastic growth in wafer laser scribing equipment with firms working to meet the next-generation technology requirements. Driven by innovations and the increasing adoption of laser scribing across industrial applications.
Trends
With all these developments going on in the wafer laser scribing equipment market, several key trends are developed, defining the future sequence of the segment. One of the main trends is related to miniaturization and integration of semiconductor equipment; to enable this trend, many more advanced scribing technologies using increased precision and effectiveness are required. With the current challenging packaging trend, which is leading toward smaller packages and increasing complexity, a scribing laser system will require patterns and tolerances that will push the envelope for producing high-performance integrated circuits and components. Another major trend is the growth of green technology and energy efficiency, mainly in the application of electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. The underlying technology is quite advanced and demanding for high-performance semiconductors, so the adoption of advanced laser scribing solutions is on the rise worldwide. Additionally, automation and Industry 4.0 in semiconductor manufacturing will upgrade equipment in laser scribing to heightened functionality that will have a positive impact on throughput and repeatability, yet with less operation cost. The development of advanced, ultrafast, and high-power laser technologies further expands the processing potentials in new areas of materials and applications, where increasing opportunities arise from many industrial segments. Hence, growing emphasis upon precision, efficiency, and flexibility in wafer processing, changing the market demand toward more sophisticated and versatile laser scribing solutions.
Size
On the other hand, wafer laser scribing equipment is a fast-growing market, driven by the increasing requirements of the semiconductor industry and rapidly changing technology. Current estimates peg it at a valuation in the few billion dollar range, where the CAGR is expected to be around 10-15 percent during the next ten years. This growth can be put down to the increasing adoption of laser technology in a wide variety of applications such as consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and renewable energy systems. The proliferation of the smart device market, electric vehicles, and renewable energy generate demand for high-performance semiconductor components, thus creating a backlog for sophisticated scribing equipment. Moreover, the market is also powered by continuous innovations in technology that would improve the capability of laser scribing through improvement in laser power, precision, and automation. Geographically, Asia-Pacific holds a huge market due to its domination in semiconductor device manufacturing and a strong presence of key industry participants. While North America and Europe also play their role in market growth, this comes along with increased investments in advanced manufacturing technologies and attention to high-end electronic applications. Overall, the wafer laser scribing equipment market is envisioned to grow much, helped by technological progress and increasing demand for high-end semiconductor solutions.
Demand 
Fueled by the confluence of advances in technology and growing applications in many industries, the demand for wafer laser scribing equipment is likely to grow at an increasing breakneck speed. The aggressive need for enhanced accuracy and productivity in wafer processing created by the rapid miniaturization and increase in electronic device complexity is pushing demand from the semiconductor industry. As consumer electronics, especially those like smartphones, tablets, and wearables, become more sophisticated, so do semiconductor components that go into their makeup, calling for sophisticated laser scribing technologies. In addition, the nascent electric vehicle market contributes substantially to this demand because these sophisticated semiconductor components will be applied in advanced power management, battery systems, and infotainment systems. Another big factor is the renewable energy sector, which targets the optimization of solar panels and other energy technologies. High-performance semiconductors are key to enabling maximum energy conversion and storage. Increasing automation and Industry 4.0 in manufacturing will further drive demand for laser scribing equipment as these technologies have the goal to improve throughput, consistency, and operational efficiency. Innovations in laser technology, like ultrafast and high-power lasers that are under development, further enlarge the range of processable materials and applications, hence the market. In general, demand for wafer laser scribing equipment is expected to grow with increasing electronic complexity and advancing technology into a broad variety of applications in high-tech industries.
Conclusion
The wafer laser scribing equipment market is going to grow drastically due to the development in technology, increasing demand for high-precision semiconductor components, and expanding applications of laser scribing across various industries. As electronic devices become more complex and technology moves towards energy efficiency, the demand for more exact and efficient scribing solutions becomes imperative.
