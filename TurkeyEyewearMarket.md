Outlook
The prospects of the Turkish eyeglasses market are promising, reflecting increased awareness among consumers, economic growth, and changing fashion trends. In view of this upward trend where more and more Turkish citizens are concerned with their eye health and their fashion sense with eyewear, further growth can be sustained. Equally, a growing middle class and increasing disposable incomes tend to boost demand for high-and low-end eye-wear, including prescription glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses. Innovation in the technology of lenses, such as anti-reflective coatings and blue light filters, extends choices further to the consumer. Improvement in frames and their materials adds to the growth in this market. E-commerce platforms have further increased the accessibility of the market, as today shoppers can get a wide range of eyewear options from the comfort of their homes. Besides, the ever-increasing consumption of digital devices and, thereby, the increase in eye strain will continue to drive the demand for value-added eyewear solutions. This dynamic interaction in the market between domestic and foreign brands, to which is added the growing attention toward personalized and stylish glasses, presumes further growth in the market in the next years.
Trends
Some of the key trends seen in the Turkish eyewear market, which have been shaping its future course, relate to growth in demand for health-oriented eyewear solutions underpinning growing awareness with regards to digital eye fatigue, myopia, presbyopia, and other diseases. More value-added features in lenses, such as filtering out the blue light, UV protection, and adaptive tinting, are being requested by increasing numbers of people. Another highly observed trend seems to be that fashion is fast turning into a driving force in eyeglasses, since people no longer seek just functionality but also a fashion statement from their glasses. With this increasing demand, sales of designer and bespoke eyewear are soaring upward, along with increasing collaborations between eyewear brands and luxury fashion designers. Besides that, growing e-commerce and developing online retail creates new distribution channels for eye wearers, making a wider range accessible to the customer. This will most likely develop into new virtual try-on opportunities. Furthermore, all this has contributed to the adoption of more ecological and sustainable materials since there is increased awareness among customers to be more environmentally friendly. To this effect, eye-wear companies invest in new innovative materials and manufacturing processes to try and keep up with such demand. Generally speaking, these trends have culminated in a dynamic and fast-developing market in which health benefits have joined fashion, convenience, and sustainability.
