Global EV Propylene Glycol Coolant Cost Breakdown
The general cost makeup of propylene glycol coolant, particularly for application in EV, is multi-factorial; thus, pricing turns out to be complex. The next scheme is a general outline of that:
1. Raw Materials Cost:
• Petroleum-Based Propylene Glycol: Conventionally, propylene glycol was manufactured from petroleum-based raw materials. Hence, this is priced based on the cost of crude oil. Costs in this are the cost of crude oil, processing cost, and costs of other associated chemical synthesis processes.
• Bio-Based Propylene Glycol: This is an analogous derivation from raw materials of renewable origin, including glycerine. The price quoted is EXWORKS, where there is an element of raw material acquisition involved, so this price may vary under the influence of commodities associated with the products derived from agricultural raw materials. Switchover to bio-based chemicals can prove costly at times due to not fully developed supply lines and increased manufacturing costs.
2. Production and Manufacturing Costs:
• Energy Consumption: The production of propylene glycol requires a massive amount of energy consumption for its distillation, purification, and other associated processes that raise its production cost.
• Technology and Equipment: Investments made in new and advanced technologies for efficiency improvement or, on the other hand, the shifting of the production process to a bio-based process increases capital expenditure.
•	Labor Costs: Manpower-related expenses for operation, maintenance, and control of the overall production process are another major factor.
3. Transportation and Distribution Costs:
•	Shipping: To transport propylene glycol from the production facilities down to the end-user, fuel, logistics, and packaging are required.
•	Storage: Relevant storage facilities needs to be provided in line with maintaining stability and quality, and, therefore, may add to distribution costs.
4. Regulatory Compliance and Safety Standards:
• Environmental Regulations: Compliance with stringent environmental regulations, especially in mature markets, can add to the cost increase. The companies may have to make investments in technologies for cleaner production or sometimes even meet the expense of certifications.
• Safety Standards: Spending on the safety of coolant standards during handling, transportation, and use is continuously changing; labeling and packaging add to the cost of expenditure.
5. Market Factors:
• Demand vs. Supply: With increasing general demand for EVs and all products that have some relation to them, it will cause an increase in price through the lifted demand for propylene coolants.
• Competition: In case there are a number of different suppliers and competitive pricing strategies laid out, then that should affect the price the consumer pays.
•	Geopolitical Factors: Any such event, be it in the form of trade restriction, tariffs, or even simple geopolitical instability, is bound to affect raw material availability and thereby its price.
6. Final Product Pricing:
•	Branding and Marketing: Brand image and marketing strategies are again areas from where companies can command a premium.
•	Applications at End-User Level: In the case of coolants, customizations for some specific EV applications may create price differentials.
These two aspects will then affect the final pricing of propylene glycol coolants used in EVs. Prices differ, hence, from region to region, by kind of glycol used, and market conditions.
